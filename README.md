# 40-Days-Of-Code

40 days of code, starting from 6th March , 2024 to 14th April, 2024

try next : complete ID3, add plotting option with backtracking, on continuous data

## Day 23: March 28, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Finished Pytorch code for linear dataset , will start on a non linear dataset next

**Thoughts** Linear regression is not as interesting as non linear data so i am glad i can start non linear data now!

## Day 22: March 27, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Started writing classification code but opted for more tensors practice first

**Thoughts** This current work is comparatively easy but tedious. I hope i can finish the tensor operations tomorrow

## Day 21: March 26, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Finished implementing utility functions (losses, activations etc), also implemented backpropagation. The backpropagation step is the 'backward' function in the code:

**Thoughts** Yesterday was slow, but today i made lot of progress.

## Day 20: March 25, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Studied Maths for Loss functions and Backpropagation. Only maths, no coding , so no screenshots for today!

**Thoughts** I wasted quite a bit of time, hoped to reach the coding part but didnt reach. Will finish backpropagation tomorrow.

## Day 19: March 24, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Studied and implemented activation functions

**Thoughts** I will be starting proper backpropagation around Day 21 or 22. Looking forward to that :)

## Day 18: March 23, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Started writing layers and forward pass for ANN

**Thoughts** Progress has sped up, but only a bit. I'm still optimistic.

## Day 17: March 22, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Set up Pytorch and setup dataset loading

**Thoughts** Progress is slower than i thought, but alright.

## Day 16: March 21, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Studied maths for ANN, gonna start implementing tomorrow

**Thoughts** Due to some outside circumstance , I have to start ANN so i'll pause Classical ML for now and jump to ANN. I'm a bit nervous yet excited!

**Link(s) to work** Only maths, so no code for today

## Day 15: March 20, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Was not in right mindframe for ML so did graph algorithms practice instead.

**Thoughts** Today was also bit hectic, im gonna continue ML from 21st.

## Day 14: March 19, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: MISSED

**Thoughts** Quiz on 20th, plus poor time management on my part.

## Day 13: March 18, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Started implementing new algo for decision tree, only halfway done .

**Thoughts** Was very tired from classes so progress was very slow.

**Link(s) to work** 1.![Day 13](./img/Day13.png "Day 13")

## Day 12: March 17, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Tested stuff on decision tree more. Unexpectedly, the tree which i thought was overfitting (the above one) is givin nearly 100% accurate results in testing, while the simplified model is failing. I plan to ask a friend about this tomorrow.
**Thoughts** Postponed some important stuff to the evening result of which couldnt do some of it. ML was main priority though. Will try not to repeat this tomorrow.

**Link(s) to work** 1.![Day 12](./img/Day12.png "Day 12")

## Day 11: March 16, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Discretized the tree! Over two hours spent in writing the 'discretize' function , which converts the values from decimals to integers. Will wrap up decision trees tomorrow with some methods to increase accuracy, and some other algorithms which i find ( i only implemented the main one ID3).

**Thoughts** Wasted quite a bit of time today since no classes in afternoon. Coded late into the night, will probably have to catch sleep through naps.

1. This is the function! ![Day 11](./img/Day11a.png "Day 11")
1. Discretising may seem simple, but basically my tree went from looking like the one at top, to the one at bottom. The accuracy dropped from 100% to 66%. I will work tomorrow on other methods to increase accuracy. ![Day 11](./img/Day11b.png "Day 11r")

## Day 10: March 15, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Continued Decision Tree. Finished implementing training part. Right now tree coming too big so pruning and testing accuracy etc steps are needed.

**Thoughts** Procastinated a bit in night so started the ML at midnight. Otherwise good day.
PS : Tree coming too big on actual dataset, so here i have shown the tree for small dataset (20 points).

## Day 9: March 14, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Continued Decision Tree. Same deadline of completion : Day 10 or 11.

**Thoughts** Didn't have a good day, but tried to not let that affect my coding. Fell asleep on the laptop from exhaustion. <br>
PS No flashy stuff or plots today :)

## Day 8: March 13, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Finished Logistic regression (picture is of final results) <br> Also started decision trees. Will try and complete by Day 10-11.

**Thoughts** Had a busy evening but wasted time in afternoons. Coded late into the night. Gearing up for a busy Thursday as well.

PS the right half of the picture is new, the left half is more or less same as Day 7

## Day 7: March 12, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Continued Logistic regression, Managed to fix the last bugs with some outside help, now my predictions are coming properly. <br>
My training accuracy and predictions are similar to sklearn's , but my weights are somewhat different. Will explore more on this tomorrow

**Thoughts** Wasted a bit of time but got on track in evening. Successful day overall :)

## Day 6: March 11, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Continued Logistic regression, With some tinkering around, and introducing some randomness, now im managing to get a good curve ~ 50% of the time.

**Thoughts** Had a long day so not much time for myself, fell asleep after coding for an hour. <br>
PS : The plot on the left is using my implementation, right one is what i'm trying to reach

## Day 5: March 10, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Continued Logistic regression, changed dataset, my gradient descent algo still has some problem

**Thoughts** Lost motivation in evening and wasted time, started coding at midnight. Overall not very good day. <br>
PS : The plot on the left is using my implementation, right one is what i'm trying to reach

## Day 4: March 9, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Started Logistic regression, but not getting good results, will improve tomorrow

**Thoughts** Had a productive day overall, but my implementation of logistic regression doesn't work well :( [The plot shown is also visibly messy]

## Day 3: March 8, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Finished unregularised Linear regression, will do regularised version tomorrow

**Thoughts** Wasted quite a lot of time today, and started coding late, so finished past midnight. Will start tomorrow morning itself.

## Day 2: March 7, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Started implementing Linear regression (ML), halfway done

**Thoughts** Very fun. VScode dark mode is cherry on top.

## Day 1: March 6, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Started DP questions on Leetcode and interviewbit.

**Thoughts** Struggling to get proper DP intuition for now, only got some simple questions correct.
