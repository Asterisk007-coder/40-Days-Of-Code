# 40-Days-Of-Code

40 days of code, starting from 6th March , 2024 to 14th April, 2024

## Day 5: March 10, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Continued Logistic regression, changed dataset, my gradient descent algo still has some problem

**Thoughts** Lost motivation in evening and wasted time, started coding at midnight. Overall not very good day. <br>
PS : The plot on the left is using my implementation, right one is what i'm trying to reach

## Day 4: March 9, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Started Logistic regression, but not getting good results, will improve tomorrow

**Thoughts** Had a productive day overall, but my implementation of logistic regression doesn't work well :( [The plot shown is also visibly messy]

**Today's Progress**: Finished unregularised Linear regression, will do regularised version tomorrow

**Thoughts** Wasted quite a lot of time today, and started coding late, so finished past midnight. Will start tomorrow morning itself.
