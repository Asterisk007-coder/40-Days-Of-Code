## Some info about how and why I started this challenge

### Rules : 
You may have heard of the 100DaysOfCode challenge, the rules for this one are similar : 
1. **At least** one hour of coding **daily**.
2. Reading tutorial texts / watching videos do not count.
3. Implementating stuff for practice , solving unsolved problems, and trying out new problems counts.
4. My main fields of focus : Graph and DP problems, Data Analytics, Classical Machine learning

### Why 40 Days ? Why not 100 ?
Well, I have my major exams in April end, so I decided to commit to 40 days for now.

### Why start now? Why not wait after exams.
I heard from a friend that reaching a decent level of coding is possible through a month of regular practice. I'm putting that to the test, to see it for myself.
